# angular2-basic-playground


very basic setup for playing with angular. compiles TS files on the fly. 
no need for gulp, grunt, webpack etc
just run live-server or http-server from the root or type "npm start"   


please note, these examples were created when learning Angular2 so they are a bit of a mess and the commit messages probably don't make very much sense :)

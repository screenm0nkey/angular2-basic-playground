# angular2-basic-examples


very basic setup for playing with Angular2 and RxJs. Compiles TS files on the fly. 
No need for gulp, grunt, webpack etc
Just run live-server or http-server from the root or type "npm start"   


Please note, these examples were created whilst I was learning Angular2 so they are a bit of a mess and the commit messages probably don't make very much sense :)

# A collection of Angular2 examples

Very basic setup for playing with Angular2 and RxJs. Compiles TS files on the fly. No need for gulp, grunt, webpack etc  

Just run live-server or http-server from the root or type "npm start"   

Please note, these examples were created whilst I was learning Angular2, which I now use as a resource.  

Almost all of the examples I've created are taken from other repos or blogs :)
